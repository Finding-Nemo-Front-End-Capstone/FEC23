# Description
FEC23 is a revamp of an e-Commerce webpage designed to display relevant product information and allow user engagement for a given product.

The FEC23 webpage can be split into the following subcomponents:

### Product Overview
The landing page of the featured product's preview image, image gallery, distinct styles, stock, and description. Users are able to select different available styles, sizes, share the featured product on social media, and add valid quantities of any given style and size to their cart.

### Questions and Answers (Q&A)
Contains the questions and answers pertaining to the featured product. The Q&A subcomponent allows user interaction with any given question or answer such as marking an input as helpful/not helpful, dynamically rendering questions matching a search query, and allowing users to ask a new question or add an answer to an existing question.
